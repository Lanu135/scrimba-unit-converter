The requirments were the following

no stretch goals where given

## Summary:

I used the darkmode version of the Figma design. First I have build the structure of the website an the design. After that I applied the functionality to the website. I used the learned from the previous lections of Scrimba. For example Number() to convert the string of the input field to a Number, number.toFixed(x) to set a certain amount of decimal places.

Also used git the first time to push the commits to github.
